## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties


### What I learned

At the course of this lesson, i learnt how to systematically arrange the codes based on the order they should follow.


### Continued development

In the nearest future i hope to learn how to make use of CSS better than i do, because the CSS gave me a tough time during this project.
